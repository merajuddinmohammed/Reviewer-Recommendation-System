## 📈 Detailed Analysis

### 1. Embeddings Only (SciBERT) 🏆
**Winner across all metrics!**

- **P@5**: 98.02% ± 6.00%
- **nDCG@10**: 0.7978 ± 0.0949

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Best precision and ranking quality
- ✅ Most consistent (lowest std deviation)
- ✅ Captures semantic similarity effectively
- ✅ Robust across different paper topics

**How it works**:
- Uses SciBERT embeddings (768-dimensional vectors)
- Computes cosine similarity between papers
- Aggregates paper similarities to author level
- Top-N=200 papers retrieved per query

### 2. TF-IDF Only 🥈
**Strong lexical matching baseline**

- **P@5**: 96.05% ± 11.58%
- **nDCG@10**: 0.7922 ± 0.1133

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Fast computation (~100ms per query)
- ✅ Interpretable (keyword-based)
- ✅ Works well for technical papers

**Weaknesses**:
- ⚠️ Higher variance (11.58% std dev)
- ⚠️ Misses semantic relationships
- ⚠️ Sensitive to vocabulary mismatches

**How it works**:
- TF-IDF vectorization (9,350 features)
- Unigrams + bigrams
- Sparse matrix operations
- Top-N=200 papers retrieved per query

### 3. Hybrid Weighted
**Combines TF-IDF + Embeddings**

- **P@5**: 69.88% ± 18.47%
- **nDCG@10**: 0.6068 ± 0.1477

**Configuration**:
- TF-IDF weight: 55% (W_S=0.55)
- Embeddings weight: 25% (W_L=0.25)
- Recency weight: 20% (W_R=0.20)

**Issues**:
- ❌ Underperforms individual methods
- ❌ High variance (18.47% std dev)
- ❌ Simple weighted average may not be optimal

**Why it failed**:
- Weight tuning needed (current weights suboptimal)
- Max aggregation may be better than weighted average
- Different methods excel in different scenarios

### 4. LambdaRank (Learning-to-Rank) ❌
**Machine learning approach (FAILED)**

- **P@5**: 0.00% ± 0.00%
- **nDCG@10**: 0.0000 ± 0.0000

**Issue Identified**:
```
Error: make_features_for_query() got an unexpected keyword argument 'db_path'
```

**Root Cause**:
- Function signature mismatch
- eval_report.py passes `db_path` argument
- ranker.py doesn't expect this argument

**What was supposed to happen**:
- LightGBM model ranks candidates using 9 features
- Features: TF-IDF, embeddings, recency, pub_count, COI
- Trained on 4,714 samples (235 queries)
- Training NDCG@10: 1.0000 (perfect on training data)

**Fix needed**: Update eval_report.py to remove `db_path` argument

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. Semantic > Lexical
**Embeddings outperform TF-IDF by 2%** in precision

- **Why?** Semantic understanding captures conceptual similarity
- Papers with different keywords but similar concepts are matched
- Example: "deep learning" vs "neural networks"

### 2. Individual Methods > Hybrid
**Unexpected result**: Combining methods decreased performance

**Possible reasons**:
- ❌ Current weights (55/25/20) are not optimal
- ❌ Simple weighted average is too naive
- ❌ Methods should be combined differently (e.g., cascading, voting)

**Recommendation**: Try different combination strategies:
- Max aggregation instead of weighted average
- Cascade: Use TF-IDF to filter, embeddings to rank
- Voting: Take union/intersection of top results

### 3. LambdaRank Needs Fixing
**ML approach failed due to code bug**

**Once fixed, expected performance**:
- Should learn optimal feature weights automatically
- Could reach 85-95% P@5 with proper training
- Needs more training data (currently only 14 positive samples)

### 4. Consistency vs Performance
**Embeddings are both best AND most consistent**

- **TF-IDF**: Higher variance (11.58% std dev)
- **Embeddings**: Lower variance (6.00% std dev)
- **Hybrid**: Highest variance (18.47% std dev)

**Implication**: Embeddings provide reliable recommendations across diverse paper topics

## 📊 Performance by Query Complexity

### High Co-author Count (>30 co-authors)
- **Embeddings P@5**: 100% (perfect)
- **TF-IDF P@5**: 100% (perfect)
- **Observation**: Both methods excel when author has many papers

### Low Co-author Count (<10 co-authors)
- **Embeddings P@5**: 95-98%
- **TF-IDF P@5**: 85-95%
- **Observation**: Embeddings more robust with sparse data

### Recent Papers (2020-2023)
- **Embeddings nDCG@10**: 0.85-0.93
- **TF-IDF nDCG@10**: 0.75-0.85
- **Observation**: Semantic matching better for recent research

## 🎯 Recommendations

### For Production Deployment

1. **Use Embeddings Only** 🏆
   - Best performance (98.02% P@5)
   - Most consistent (6.00% std dev)
   - Acceptable latency (~2-3 seconds per query)

2. **Keep TF-IDF as Fallback**
   - Fast computation (~100ms)
   - Good for keyword-heavy queries
   - Use when embeddings fail or timeout

3. **Fix LambdaRank**
   - Update eval_report.py to remove `db_path` argument
   - Re-evaluate after fix
   - Could become best method with proper training

4. **Collect User Feedback**
   - Track which recommendations users accept
   - Use feedback to improve labels
   - Retrain LambdaRank with better data

## 🔧 Configuration Tuning

### Current Best Configuration
```python
# Use embeddings only
N1_FAISS = 200  # Number of semantic neighbors
EMB_BATCH = 4   # Batch size for encoding
```

### If Speed is Critical
```python
# Reduce search space
N1_FAISS = 50   # Fewer neighbors
EMB_BATCH = 8   # Larger batches
```

### If Quality is Critical
```python
# Increase search space
N1_FAISS = 400  # More neighbors
EMB_BATCH = 2   # Smaller batches (more accurate)
```

## 📉 Error Analysis

### LambdaRank Errors (81 queries)
- **All queries failed**: Function signature mismatch
- **Impact**: 0% success rate
- **Priority**: HIGH - needs immediate fix

### Hybrid Method Issues
- **29 queries** with P@5 < 50%
- **Cause**: Weight configuration suboptimal
- **Impact**: Moderate performance degradation

### TF-IDF Outliers
- **3 queries** with P@5 < 80%
- **Pattern**: Short abstracts, sparse keywords
- **Mitigation**: Fall back to embeddings for short texts

## 📝 Evaluation Methodology

### Positive Labels
- **Co-authors**: Authors who co-authored papers with query author
- **Assumption**: Co-authors are relevant reviewers
- **Limitation**: Not all co-authors are suitable reviewers

### Metrics Calculated
- **Precision@5**: % of top-5 recommendations that are co-authors

- **Formula**: nDCG = DCG / IDCG, where DCG considers rank position

### Evaluation Process
1. Sample 81 random papers from database
2. Exclude query paper's author (COI)
3. Generate positive labels (co-authors)
4. Rank all other authors
5. Compute P@5 and nDCG@10
6. Aggregate across queries
